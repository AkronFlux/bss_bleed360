Worth your time, trust me.<br>Yesterday, during the reverse update, I touched on two words that tend to make people uneasy: <em>downturn</em> and <em>restructuring</em>. Why bring them up? Because some of you—though not all—have been whispering about them. And frankly, if I were in your shoes, I’d want to know the people steering this ship had a plan. Or at least <em>sounded</em> like they did.<br><br>I’m no economist, but let’s be realistic: we’re staring down the barrel of a prolonged global slump, with inflation sticking around like a bad smell. Liz Truss might be praying for a miracle, but we’re not betting on one. Markets are shifting, decisions are slowing, and uncertainty is the new normal. We saw this coming—maybe not the specifics (who predicted Putin’s little adventure or the energy circus?), but we knew <em>something</em> would hit. Prudent planning, right?<br><br>The first casualty of a downturn? Speed. Clients hesitate, sectors retract. Luckily, our positioning is <em>flexible</em>—unlike those poor souls in B2C data marketing. We’re sector-agnostic, and our focus areas? Some might even thrive in the chaos. Funding for startups and scale-ups? Already dried up. (If you haven’t read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/19/yc-advises-founders-to-plan-for-the-worst/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external">this</a>, you should. It’s why we secured that cash facility—just in case. Plan A is we won’t need it. Plan B is we smile while others scramble.)<br>Recessions create winners. We intend to be one. We’ll stay nimble, double down on counter-cyclical sectors—energy, utilities, supply chain—and let competitors flounder. Grow, secure new clients, overdeliver to the existing ones, and we’ll emerge stronger. Simple.<br>Now, the question that reached me: <em>“If cuts happen, is it last in, first out?”</em> That one stung. Not because it was asked—ask away—but because someone out there thinks that’s how we’d operate. Or worse, how <em>I’d</em> operate.<br>Let’s be clear: <strong>We’re not in danger of cuts.</strong> Business is solid, if a little sluggish (hence the cash cushion). Our backers want growth, and we’re delivering. But let’s not pretend we’re immune. Ninety percent of our costs are people. If we <em>had</em> to trim, we’d slow hiring first, let attrition do its thing, and treat redundancies as a last, <em>regrettable</em> resort.<br>And for the record? <strong>Last in, first out is for cowards.</strong> I’ve run enough redundancy programmes to know better. If it ever comes to that, it’ll be strategic, not lazy. That said, any redundancies at all would be a personal failure. So no, we’re not there. We’re hiring. We’re expanding. And by year’s end, we’ll have <em>more</em> bodies in seats, not fewer.<br>But inflation? That’s real. And it’s hitting the lower earners hardest. So here’s what we’re doing:<br><br><strong>Flat-rate salary bumps for everyone</strong> (leadership excluded, obviously).<br><br>Maths dictates this means a ~10% boost for average roles, more for the lower bands.<br><br><br><strong>Phased increases</strong> to soften the blow on our cash flow:<br><br><strong>1 Oct:</strong> +£2,500 annual<br><strong>1 Jan:</strong> +£1,250 annual<br><strong>1 April:</strong> +£1,250 annual<br><br><br><strong>Probation rule:</strong> Join in August, pass in November? You’ll miss October’s increase but catch the rest.<br><br>Why this way?<br><br><strong>Lower earners need it most.</strong> (Good PR, too.)<br><strong>Salaries &gt; one-off bonuses.</strong> Recurring costs for them, recurring goodwill for us.<br><strong>Performance-based?</strong> Please. Inflation doesn’t care how hard you work.<br><strong>Spread out?</strong> Easier on our books. And yes, we <em>can</em> afford it.<br><br>Could we have done more? Maybe. But this balances <em>your</em> needs with <em>our</em> sustainability. And if inflation keeps climbing? We’ll revisit. Feedback welcome—publicly or in stand-ups.<br>Bottom line: My job isn’t to make you happy. But if I can ease worries, deflect panic, and give you just enough to keep pushing, I will. Because a stable team is a productive team. And productivity? That’s how we all win.</p></div><script src="../assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="../assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
